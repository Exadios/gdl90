GDL90 Encode/Decode for Aviation Devices and Software

This is a single header file to help encode/decode standard GDL90 messages. It does not do the actual sending and receiving of the datagrams. That's up to you.

See the comments at the top of GDL90.h for more discussion of the functionality and examples.

This all open source. See the LICENSE.md (MIT) file for details.
